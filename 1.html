        <strong>creating <u>web</u> pages</strong> and web applications.
        Web browsers recrive HTML documents from a web server or from local storage and render them into multimedia web
        pages.
        HTML descripbes the strucuture of a web page semantically and originally included cues for the appearance of the
        document.</p><img src="photo1.jpg" alt="" width="600px">
    <p style="margin-top:45px;"> tell me if you're really there Don't make me fall in love again If he won't be here
        next year
        Santa tell me if he really cares Cause I can't give it all away
        If he won't be here next year Feeling Christmas all around And I'm trying to play it cool But it's hard to focus
        When I see him walking cross the room Let it snow, is blasting now
        But I won't get it in the mood I'm avoiding every mistletoe
        Until I know its true love That he thinks of So next Christmas I'm not all alone boy</p>
