        My presence sweet and my aura bright
        Diamonds good for my appetite
        Guess it fuckin' just clicked one night
        All them demons helped me see shit differently
        So don't be sad for me
        How you been spending your time? (How?)
        How you be using your tongue? (How?)
        You be so worried 'bout mine (Mine)
        Can't even get yourself none
        You know you sound so dumb (So dumb, so dumb)
        You know you sound so dumb (So dumb)
        So maybe you should shut up, mmm
        Yeah, maybe you should shut up
        Said if only you would shut up (Mmm)
        Yeah, that's right, you should shut up (Ah)
        I vibrate high and my circle lit
